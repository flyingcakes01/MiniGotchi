            <h2>Introduction: How Minigotchi Works</h2>
            <p>Minigotchi is a streamlined Wi-Fi penetration testing tool designed to function on lightweight microcontrollers like the ESP8266 and ESP32. It utilizes low-level Wi-Fi frame manipulation to interact with nearby networks, detect and communicate with other Minigotchi or Pwnagotchi devices, and perform deauthentication attacks for educational and security research purposes. Its design philosophy focuses on minimalism and efficiency, making it accessible to both beginners and advanced users interested in network security.</p>
            <p>The core functionalities of Minigotchi include detecting nearby Wi-Fi networks, sending out "advertisement" beacon frames, and engaging in deauthentication processes to help users better understand the vulnerabilities in common network setups. This approach allows users to experiment with Wi-Fi security in a controlled and ethical environment.</p>
            <p>Minigotchi is not just a tool; it's a learning platform. By understanding its operations, users gain a deeper insight into Wi-Fi communication protocols and the potential security flaws that can be exploited if not properly mitigated.</p>

            <h2>Configuration Guide</h2>
            <p>Minigotchi offers flexible configuration options that allow you to customize its behavior according to your needs. Here are the basic steps to configure Minigotchi:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Edit Configuration Files:</strong> After flashing the firmware, navigate to the `config.cpp` file to modify settings such as Wi-Fi channels, network whitelisting, and display options. Each parameter is well-commented, providing clear guidance on what each setting does.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust Power Settings:</strong> Depending on your environment, you may need to adjust the power settings to optimize performance and minimize interference with other devices. These settings are also available in the configuration file.</li>
                <li><strong>Save and Reboot:</strong> After making your desired changes, save the configuration file and reboot Minigotchi. The new settings will be applied, and you can verify them via the serial monitor.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Proper configuration is crucial for optimal performance. Take the time to understand each setting to fully leverage Minigotchi's capabilities. And remember, a well-configured Minigotchi is a happy Minigotchi!</p>

            <h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
            <p>Using Minigotchi effectively requires understanding its core commands and functionalities. Here’s a brief overview of how to use Minigotchi for Wi-Fi network analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Detection:</strong> Minigotchi will automatically scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and display them on the serial monitor or connected display. You can use this information to select specific targets for further analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Beacon Frame Advertising:</strong> Minigotchi can send out beacon frames to advertise its presence to other devices. This feature is particularly useful for interacting with other Minigotchi or Pwnagotchi devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Deauthentication Attacks:</strong> For educational and testing purposes, Minigotchi can perform deauthentication attacks to disrupt connections to specific access points. Use this feature responsibly and only on networks where you have permission to test.</li>
            </ul>
